So, it’s tome to wake up
Turn the VOX 30 watts up
A Telecaster worn
by a suburban boy
Jammin’ away with
his garage band
Working part-time is so EMO
And his rivals crush his EGO
Sick and tired of
your excuses “Anti-social” BOY
All these outsider put money
where thier mouth is
Threatening society and
loser like me
Boys be ambitious...
like this old man
Hey there godforsaken dude
So tell me who you worship
Worship, worship
Hell don’t get me wrong
because the guru lies in you
Rockin’ rockin’ roll
rockin’ rockin’ roll
Make love with
your electric guiter
Oh baby,
don’t stop, don’t stop!
So, are you giving up,
better show me what you’ve got
Oh baby,
rockin’ rockin’ roll,
rockin’ rockin’ roll
So, take a step
New song in the brew?
Is it buzzing too?
“Your name is game,
but your fame is lame
so I feel really bad for you”
Your wear a ridiculous icon
Where the hell is your-life icon
They say
it’s time to act your age
Your heart is still a BOY
No matter how clever you
attempt to endeavor
Like it or not, in ten years,
your colors will show
Boys be ambitious...
like this old man
Your Instagram is on the line
It’s time to “Take a Selfy”
“Selfy” “Selfy”
I’ll see you on the other side,
if only we survive!!
Rockin’ rockin’ roll
rockin’ rockin’ roll
Just give me
another cheesy love song
Don’t stop! Don’t stop!
So, are you giving up?
Better show me what you’ve got
Oh baby,
rockin’ rockin’ roll
rockin’ rockin’ roll
Blinded by perfection
but can’t get no satisfaction
All there pricey goods and
gizmos they try to seduce
me with
Sanity? Insanity?
The pressure is crushing
“Hate to break the news
but my voice died
the show is off tonight”
Huh? Say what?
No way! Shut up!
Say wisecracks and
keep dreaming, baby
I’ll see you on the other side,
if only we survive!!
Rockin’ rockin’ roll
rockin’ rockin’ roll
Make love with
your electric guiter
Oh baby,
don’t stop, don’t stop!
So, are you giving up,
better show me
what you’ve got
Oh baby,
rockin’ rockin’ roll,
rockin’ rockin’ roll
Rockin’ rockin’ roll
Rockin’ rockin’ roll
Rockin’ rockin’ roll
I’ll see you on the other side!
Get ready for a rocky ride!
We’ll rock n’ roll
until we die!
Better make it through alive!
